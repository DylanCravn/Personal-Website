                        </h1>
                        <p>My name is Dylan Craven, welcome to my website. On here you will find everything you need to get to know me. But first, 
                            a little about myself. I am currently a juior studying computer science at Texas A&M University. My passsion for computer science 
                            has grown as I have learned more and more about the field. Through the team projects, competitions, and people I have met as a student, 
                            both my excitement and curiosity have grown immensely. Beyond computer science, I love to play volley ball, practice photography, and tavel 
                            to new and exciting places.

                        <p>
                            As I head into the future, I have a few key paths in mind. In no particular order; software engineering, <br>and teaching are very compelling career paths to me.
                            software engineering is where I believe I can really develop my abilities, learn new skills and experience new environments.<br>
                             I have always had a nack for problem solving and back end software engineering has always been facinating to me. For the time being I am conintuing to hone my abilities and knowledge<br>
                             to hopefully enter this field soon. Another area the has interested me for quite some time is teaching. My first experience with computer science was in high school. <br>
                             The expose to this subject is something I will never forget. I immediately fell in love with the problem solbing aspects, the challenges and logical nature of the subject. <br>
                             That is why I certainly have a desire to be the one who shows young people the joy I experienced. With these two things in mind I definitely have to shortage of passion for <br>
                             computer science. So whether I go into software engineering or teaching, I will have to master this subject before I can make that decision. For now I will engage in project, <br>
                             new challenges and continue to learn.
